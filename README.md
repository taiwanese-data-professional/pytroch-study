# Pytorch Study Group
---

## Motivation and Goal

We are a group of ppl interesting in implementing pytorch to different fields of industry. We follow [Mozilla Study Group Guidance](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/1-about-study-groups.html). This group is currently led by @henirlin28 and @easonla

Our goal is to help data professionals what is pytorch and how deep learning can advance their career. For such a reason, we will start with a general introduction about pytorch and neural network. Our fist study group will be hosted at 3/18/2019. Each week we will dive deeper into the world of deep learning and pytorch.
